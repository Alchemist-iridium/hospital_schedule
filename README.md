# hospital_schedule
a scheduling system with incentive of working on certain shift

## Description
A website, written in Python together with Grok3
All codes are written by Grok 3, I just copy, paste, do slight modification and describe.
Takes me about one and a half day (two and a half days in total for developing and testing, additional 2 hours for updating) to finish to this extent
  update (actually the final version can't run for multiple runs, as it doen't clear all the data... plus two minor mistakes caused by copy paste human error...)
## 
- Python packages

pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy werkzeug flask-login pandas openpyxl

- run the app.py

- Test file
  data import for necessary context
  
- Admin adding: run create_admin.py
  recommend using id:0000, as it is used in other route

- testing files are for batch information

-instruction is constructed

- weight is set arbitrarily, which needs to be adjusted later in testing (the effect depends on the number of workers and the requirements)
