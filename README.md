# hospital_schedule
a scheduling system with incentive of working on certain shift

## Description
A website, written in Python together with Grok3
All codes are written by Grok 3, I just copy, paste, do slight modification and describe.
Takes me about one and a half day to finish to this extent (probably can run? I didn't do the final testing)

## 
- Python packages

pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy werkzeug flask-login pandas openpyxl

- Test file
  data import
  
- Admin adding: run create_admin.py
  recommend using id:111, as it is used in other route
