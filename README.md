# hospital_schedule
a scheduling system with incentive of working on certain shift

## Description
A website, written in Python together with Grok3
All codes are written by Grok 3, I just copy, paste, do slight modification and describe.
Takes me about one and a half day (two and a half days in total for developing and testing) to finish to this extent (Right now I'm sure it can run haha)
## 
- Python packages

pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy werkzeug flask-login pandas openpyxl

- run the app.py

- Test file
  data import for necessary context
  
- Admin adding: run create_admin.py
  recommend using id:111, as it is used in other route

- testing files are for batch information

-instruction on how the system work will be made when I have time for it (probably a long time)

- weight is set arbitrarily, which needs to be adjusted later in testing (the effect depends on the number of workers and the requirements)
